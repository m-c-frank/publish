the previous attempt didnt work because there was a bug where only the 0th index of the args was used but since i now use flags i need to somehow keep in mind that -r flag is position dependent if i want to add other functionality. no i mean i generally need to keep in mind that typing the text of the notes in the cli might be problematic as its an aritrarily sized string

maybe you get what i mean but im not sure if i explained it correctly. just look at the commit that was publsihed last by me before this note was publsihed
